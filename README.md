# finger-spelling-text
Convolutional Neural Network intended to input photos of finger spelling in American Sign Language and output a text string.



			## Notebook 0: Exploration


Demonstrating CNN use with The ASL MNIST Dataset and a simple neural network

Improvement paths from starting model

Optimizing hyperparameters via grid search (useful for smaller CNN's)

Implementing Data: ASL Alphabet

Training with Validation

Test with Larger Images

Creating a single photo of my hand signing 'A' for demo purposes

Transfer Learning

Removing a dense layer to reduce overfitting and increase fitting speed.
